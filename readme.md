# Tic Tac Toe (Vanilla JS) - Work-in-Progress

### Hello there!
This project is a part of The Odin Project's web development course and focuses on the concept of ["building a house from the inside"](https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out).

I am aware that it's generally recommended to use React for this task, but I want to get the fundamentals of ES6 JS down first. In this project I will be implementing the Factory Method design pattern.
